/*
 * MurmurHash2, by Austin Appleby
 * 
 * Note - This code makes a few assumptions about how your machine behaves -
 * 1. We can read a 4-byte value from any address without crashing
 * 2. sizeof(int) == 4
 *
 * And it has a few limitations -
 * 1. It will not work incrementally.
 * 2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
 * machines.
 *
 * Adapted to glib data types by Emil Brink. Mr Appleby's code is in the public
 * domain, so it stands to reason that this adaption is, too. Note that the
 * rest of Geanyuniq (which this file is part of) is licensed according to the
 * GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.
